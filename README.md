Dr. Vilalta introduced a complexity metric for domain adaptation tasks. By measuring class entropy for *k*-NN we determine the adaptive sampling technique on the target dataset which we append to the source dataset. Thus, training on a newly formed dataset.

Experiments:

- MNIST vs MNIST Rotated
- Yest vs Ecoli
- SMS Spam vs Email Spam
