# Experiments for Broadscale Domain Adaptation Using Adaptive Sampling and Active Learning

-------

#### MNIST dataset complexity measure based on K-NN entropy and active sampling.

- To see the already tested complexity check the visuals in /vis
- To generate the complexity of the MNIST dataset vs Rotated MNIST dataset, please run the complexity.py
